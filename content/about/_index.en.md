In **Ju Jitsu Sogndal (JJS)** we practice the martial art Ju Jitsu with a focus on self-defense. We follow a style from [Ju Jitsu Norway](http://www.jujitsu.no/) that is inspired by the traditional Japanese art of self-defense. *Ju* means gentle/flexible or yielding, and *Jitsu* means art or technique. Ju Jitsu includes techniques such as strikes, kicks, throws, releases, takedowns, chokes and control holds.

> Ju Jitsu builds body control, confidence, a sense of mastery, and strength â€“ both in body and mind.
