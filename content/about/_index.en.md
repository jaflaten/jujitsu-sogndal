In **Ju Jitsu Sogndal (JJS)** we practice the martial art Ju Jitsu with a focus on self-defense. Ju Jitsu opens for a variety of different styles and we are following a style from the [Ju Jitsu Norway (JJN)](http://www.jujitsu.no/) system that is inspired by the traditional Japanese art of self-defense. *Ju* means gentle/flexible or yielding, and *Jitsu* means art or technique. Ju Jitsu includes techniques such as strikes, kicks, throws, releases, takedowns, chokes and control holds.


> Ju Jitsu builds body control, confidence, a sense of mastery, and strength â€“ both in body and mind.
