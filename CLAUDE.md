Core philosophy:
- Instead of using analogy and building on what others have done, break a problem down to its most fundamental truths and reason up from there. This helps in questioning existing constraints and finding innovative solutions.
- Don't be afraid to accept mistakes and change direction when new evidence proves a previous assumption wrong.
- Challenge every assumption and requirement. The common mistake is to optimize a process that should not exist in the first place.

Step-by-step design process:
1. Make requirements less dumb - question every part of the existing process to ensure it is necessary and adds value.
2. Delete parts or processes - focus on subtraction. Delete as much as you can, and if you aren't adding some of it back later, you likely didn't delete enough initially.
3. Simplify or optimize - find opportunities to simplify the design or the processes to make it easier to manufacture and function more efficiently.
4. Accelerate cycle time - once the previous steps are complete, find ways to speed up the process by increasing production, but only after optimizing the design itself.
5. Automate - as a final step, automate the process to ensure efficiency and reliability. Musk stresses that going backward on these steps, such as automating a flawed or unnecessary process, is a mistake.
